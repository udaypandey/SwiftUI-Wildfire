# SwiftUI & Pre IOS 13 Support

This is a sample project which allows SwiftUI and pre IOS 13 code to coexist and provide support till IOS 9.

### Requirements

The requirement came from an existing project which supports IOS 9 and will continue to support IOS 9 for atleast a year or two.

This project does not try to provide a way for SwiftUI to work before IOS 13. Infact it just allows a way to support the existing 
app for versions prior to IOS 13 and switch to SwiftUI based `new` code for 13 and beyond.
